[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Welcome to a state-of-the-art, event-driven pipeline engineered to perform deep semantic analysis of software codebases. This system discovers, analyzes, and understands the intricate relationships within code, building a queryable, high-fidelity knowledge graph using Large Language Models (LLMs) and graph database technology.

This is not just a static analysis tool; it's a dynamic, scalable, and resilient platform for building a "living" model of your code's cognitive architecture.

## Overview

This system is architected to deconstruct a software repository and rebuild it as a knowledge graph. It achieves this by:

1.  **Discovering** all relevant files and directories, intelligently respecting `.gitignore` rules.
2.  **Analyzing** file contents using LLMs to extract key **Points of Interest (POIs)**, such as classes, functions, variables, and imports.
3.  **Triangulating Relationships** through a sophisticated multi-pass analysis, combining deterministic logic with contextual LLM queries to identify how POIs connect.
4.  **Building a Knowledge Graph** in Neo4j, representing the codebase as a network of nodes (POIs) and edges (relationships).
5.  **Providing Real-time Insight** into the analysis process through a robust REST and WebSocket API.
6.  **Maintaining Itself** by automatically cleaning up graph elements corresponding to deleted files.

The result is a powerful, queryable graph that enables advanced code navigation, dependency analysis, architectural validation, and impact analysis for refactoring.

## Core Concepts

The power of this system comes from the fusion of several key architectural patterns and concepts.

### Cognitive Triangulation

This is the core philosophy of the pipeline. Instead of relying on a single method to find relationships, I use multiple, independent "witnesses" to build confidence.

1.  **Deterministic Pass:** Identifies obvious, rule-based relationships (e.g., a file `CONTAINS` a class). This pass is fast and highly accurate.
2.  **Intra-File LLM Pass:** An LLM analyzes the POIs within a single file to find local relationships (e.g., function A `CALLS` function B in the same file).
3.  **Intra-Directory LLM Pass:** An LLM analyzes all POIs within a directory to find connections between files (e.g., one file `IMPORTS` an exported class from another).
4.  **Global LLM Pass:** After summarizing entire directories, an LLM analyzes these summaries to find high-level architectural relationships between different modules or services.

The `ConfidenceScoringService` then aggregates the "evidence" from these passes. A relationship reported by multiple passes receives a higher confidence score, filtering out noise and LLM hallucinations.

### Event-Driven & Asynchronous Architecture

The system is built on **BullMQ** and **Redis**, allowing for a highly scalable and decoupled architecture. Each stage of the pipeline is a queue, and each processing unit is a worker. This design means:

-   **Scalability:** You can run hundreds or thousands of workers across multiple machines to process massive codebases in parallel.
-   **Resilience:** If a worker fails while processing a job, BullMQ ensures the job is automatically retried, preventing data loss.
-   **Decoupling:** Each worker has a single responsibility. I can update, improve, or replace a worker (e.g., `FileAnalysisWorker`) without affecting the rest of the system.

### The Transactional Outbox Pattern

To ensure maximum reliability, I use the transactional outbox pattern via the `TransactionalOutboxPublisher`.

When a worker (like `FileAnalysisWorker`) processes a file, it doesn't immediately publish an event to the next queue. Instead, it writes its findings *and* an "event to be published" into the SQLite database within a single transaction.

A separate, dedicated `TransactionalOutboxPublisher` service polls this outbox table and reliably publishes the events to BullMQ. This guarantees **at-least-once delivery** and prevents a scenario where a worker crashes after performing its work but before it could enqueue the next job, which would otherwise halt the pipeline for that file.

### Polyglot Persistence

The system leverages two different databases for what they do best:

-   **SQLite (`better-sqlite3`):** Acts as the fast, transactional, and transient data store. It's perfect for the outbox pattern, storing intermediate POIs, and tracking job states. Its file-based nature makes it easy to manage per-run.
-   **Neo4j (Graph Database):** Serves as the final, persistent knowledge graph. It is optimized for storing and querying complex network relationships, making it the ideal destination for our analysis.

### Component Breakdown

The pipeline is a collection of specialized agents and workers, each with a distinct role.

| Component | File Path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PipelineApiService** | `src/utils/pipelineApi.js` | Provides REST and WebSocket APIs for starting, stopping, and monitoring pipeline runs in real-time. The primary user control plane. |
| **EntityScout** | `src/agents/EntityScout.js` | The starting point. Scans the target directory, respects `.gitignore`, and enqueues files into `file-analysis-queue`. |
| **FileDiscoveryBatcher** | `src/workers/fileDiscoveryBatcher.js` | An intelligent batching worker that groups files based on token count to optimize LLM API calls, improving efficiency and reducing cost. |
| **FileAnalysisWorker** | `src/workers/fileAnalysisWorker.js` | Consumes jobs from `file-analysis-queue`. Reads file content, chunks large files, and uses an LLM to extract POIs. Publishes findings to the transactional outbox. |
| **DirectoryAggregationWorker** | `src/workers/directoryAggregationWorker.js` | A coordination worker that uses Redis to track when all files within a single directory have been analyzed, triggering the `DirectoryResolutionWorker`. |
| **DirectoryResolutionWorker**| `src/workers/directoryResolutionWorker.js` | Uses an LLM to generate a high-level summary of a directory's purpose based on the contents of its files. |
| **TransactionalOutboxPublisher**|`src/services/TransactionalOutboxPublisher.js`| Polls the SQLite `outbox` table and reliably publishes events to the appropriate BullMQ queues, ensuring data consistency and at-least-once delivery. |
| **RelationshipResolver** | `src/agents/RelationshipResolver.js` | Orchestrates the multi-pass relationship extraction process (deterministic, intra-file, intra-directory, global). This is the "brain" of the analysis. |
| **RelationshipResolutionWorker**|`src/workers/relationshipResolutionWorker.js`| A dedicated worker that takes a single POI and its context, queries an LLM to find relationships, and writes findings to the outbox. |
| **ValidationWorker** | `src/workers/ValidationWorker.js` | Consumes analysis findings, stores them as "evidence" in SQLite, and uses Redis to determine when a relationship has enough evidence to be reconciled. |
| **ReconciliationWorker** | `src/workers/ReconciliationWorker.js` | Takes a relationship with all its evidence, uses `ConfidenceScoringService` to calculate a final score, and persists validated relationships to the main `relationships` table. |
| **GraphBuilder** | `src/agents/GraphBuilder.js` | The final step. Reads validated, high-confidence relationships from SQLite and executes efficient Cypher queries to build the final knowledge graph in Neo4j. |
| **SelfCleaningAgent** | `src/agents/SelfCleaningAgent.js` | A maintenance agent that runs to find files that have been deleted from the filesystem and removes their corresponding nodes and relationships from the databases. |
| **DeepSeekClient** | `src/utils/deepseekClient.js`| A native, dependency-free client for the DeepSeek LLM API, featuring concurrency management, automatic retries, and backoff logic. |
| **LLMResponseSanitizer**|`src/utils/LLMResponseSanitizer.js`| A defensive utility that cleans and repairs common formatting issues in LLM JSON output, making parsing more resilient. |
| **QueueManager** | `src/utils/queueManager.js` | A singleton wrapper around BullMQ that manages all queue and worker connections to Redis. |
| **DatabaseManager** | `src/utils/sqliteDb.js` | Manages the connection and schema for the SQLite database. |
| **neo4jDriver** | `src/utils/neo4jDriver.js` | Manages the singleton connection to the Neo4j graph database. |

## The Data Pipeline: A Step-by-Step Journey

Here is how a single file travels through the system:

1.  **Initiation**: A user submits a new pipeline run via the `POST /api/pipeline/start` endpoint, specifying a target directory.
2.  **Discovery**: `EntityScout` awakens, scans the directory, and creates a "file-analysis" job for every discovered file, placing it in the `file-analysis-queue`.
3.  **POI Extraction**: A `FileAnalysisWorker` picks up a job. It reads the file, asks the LLM to identify all POIs (functions, classes, etc.), and writes these POIs along with an event into the SQLite `outbox` table in a single transaction.
4.  **Reliable Eventing**: The `TransactionalOutboxPublisher` polls the `outbox`, sees the new event, and publishes it to the `relationship-resolution-queue`.
5.  **Relationship Triangulation**: A `RelationshipResolutionWorker` receives the POI. It orchestrates the multi-pass analysis, querying the LLM with different contexts to find potential relationships. Each piece of evidence is written to the `outbox`.
6.  **Evidence Validation**: The `ValidationWorker` consumes these evidence events from the outbox. It stores them in the `relationship_evidence` table and uses Redis to track how much evidence has been gathered for a specific potential relationship.
7.  **Reconciliation & Scoring**: Once all evidence for a relationship is collected, the `ValidationWorker` enqueues a job for the `ReconciliationWorker`. This worker fetches all evidence, calculates a final `confidence_score` using `ConfidenceScoringService`, and if the score exceeds a threshold, writes the final, validated relationship to the main `relationships` table in SQLite.
8.  **Graph Construction**: After all analysis jobs are complete, the `GraphBuilder` agent runs. It reads all validated relationships from SQLite and bulk-inserts them into Neo4j, creating the final, queryable knowledge graph.
9.  **Monitoring**: Throughout this entire process, status updates are broadcast via WebSocket, allowing a user to monitor the progress in real-time.
10. **Cleanup**: If a file is ever deleted from the source repository, the `SelfCleaningAgent` can be run to find and remove its corresponding data from both SQLite and Neo4j, keeping the graph synchronized with the codebase.

## Key Features

-   **Deep Semantic Analysis**: Goes far beyond simple pattern matching by using LLMs to understand code intent and context.
-   **Highly Scalable**: The distributed worker/queue architecture allows for massive parallel processing of large and complex codebases.
-   **Extremely Reliable**: The transactional outbox pattern guarantees that no analysis work is lost, even if parts of the system crash.
-   **Confidence-Scored Relationships**: The "Cognitive Triangulation" approach filters out LLM noise and produces a high-fidelity graph.
-   **Real-time Monitoring**: A built-in API and WebSocket server provide immediate insight into the pipeline's status, progress, and logs.
-   **Automated Graph Construction**: Fully automates the process of turning a directory of code into a queryable Neo4j knowledge graph.
-   **Language Agnostic**: Because it relies on LLMs, the system can be adapted to analyze code in any programming language.

    SQLITE_DB_PATH=./database.db
    ```

### Running the Pipeline

The system includes a user-friendly API server for managing runs.

1.  **Initialize the Database Schema:**
    This command will create the `database.db` file and set up the necessary tables.
    ```sh
    npm run init-db
    ```

2.  **Start the API Server:**
    This will start the web server and the WebSocket server for real-time updates.

    ```
    You should see output indicating the server is running on `http://localhost:3002`.

3.  **Submit a Pipeline Run:**
    Use `curl` or any API client to send a `POST` request to the `/api/pipeline/start` endpoint. Replace `/path/to/your/codebase` with the absolute path to the directory you want to analyze.

    ```sh
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/pipeline/start \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"targetDirectory": "/path/to/your/codebase"}'
    ```

4.  **Monitor the Progress:**
    -   **Terminal:** Watch the console output from the `npm run start-api` command.
    -   **REST API:** Get the status of a specific run:
        `GET http://localhost:3002/api/pipeline/status/:pipelineId`
    -   **WebSocket:** Connect a WebSocket client to `ws://localhost:3002` to receive real-time JSON patches of the pipeline status.

Once the pipeline completes, you can explore the generated knowledge graph in your Neo4j Browser.

## Database Schema

### SQLite Schema

Defined in `src/utils/schema.sql`, the SQLite database serves as the pipeline's operational datastore.

-   **`files`**: Tracks discovered files and their processing status.
-   **`pois`**: Stores Points of Interest extracted from files.
-   **`relationships`**: Stores **validated** relationships with their final confidence scores.
-   **`relationship_evidence`**: Stores all raw "evidence" for potential relationships from different analysis passes before reconciliation.
-   **`directory_summaries`**: Stores the LLM-generated summaries for each directory.
-   **`outbox`**: The transactional outbox table for reliable event publishing.

### Neo4j Graph Model

The final graph in Neo4j is simple and powerful:

-   **Nodes**:
    -   `:POI`: All Points of Interest are stored as nodes with this label.
    -   Properties: `id`, `type`, `name`, `filePath`, `startLine`, `endLine`.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   `:RELATIONSHIP`: A generic relationship type between two `:POI` nodes.
    -   Properties: `type` (e.g., 'CALLS', 'IMPORTS', 'CONTAINS'), `confidence`.

### 4. Architecture Decisions (Stored in Memory)

All architectural decisions have been stored in the Claude Flow Memory system under the namespace `swarm-auto-centralized-1751199587202/architect/`:

1. **mcp-architecture-decisions** - Core architectural decisions and rationale
2. **mcp-interfaces-summary** - Summary of interface designs
3. **mcp-implementation-guide** - Implementation roadmap

## Key Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between protocol, business logic, and infrastructure
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for language and framework support
- **Transport Agnostic**: Support for multiple communication protocols

### Integration Capabilities
- **Standalone Operation**: Can run independently as MCP server
- **Claude Code/Flow Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude ecosystem
- **Library Mode**: Can be imported and used programmatically

### Scalability Features
- **Session-Based**: Supports concurrent project analyses
- **Resource Pooling**: Efficient resource management
- **Incremental Analysis**: Only process changed files
- **Caching Layer**: Performance optimization through caching

### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions for better IDE support
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Architecture, implementation, and usage guides
- **Plugin Development Kit**: Easy extension through plugins
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit, integration, and e2e test patterns

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Implementation Team

1. **Review Architecture Documents**: Start with the main architecture document
2. **Study Interface Definitions**: Understand the TypeScript interfaces
3. **Follow Implementation Guide**: Use the phase-by-phase approach
4. **Implement Core First**: Focus on MCP protocol and transport layer
5. **Test Incrementally**: Build test suite alongside implementation

### For Project Management

1. **Resource Allocation**: Assign developers to specific phases
2. **Timeline Planning**: Use the 10-week implementation timeline
3. **Risk Management**: Monitor the identified risks
4. **Success Metrics**: Track the defined success criteria
5. **Community Engagement**: Plan for plugin ecosystem development

### For DevOps Team

1. **CI/CD Setup**: Implement the suggested pipeline
2. **Container Strategy**: Prepare Docker deployment
3. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Set up observability tools
4. **Security Scanning**: Implement security checks
5. **Performance Testing**: Create load testing scenarios

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Easy to maintain and extend
2. **Compatibility**: Works with existing pipeline code
3. **Performance**: Optimized for large codebases
4. **Security**: Built-in security considerations
5. **Flexibility**: Multiple deployment options
6. **Community**: Enables plugin ecosystem

## Conclusion

The modular MCP server architecture provides a robust foundation for exposing the Cognitive Triangulation Pipeline's capabilities through the Model Context Protocol. The design prioritizes modularity, extensibility, and integration flexibility while maintaining the proven analysis capabilities of the existing pipeline.

All architectural decisions have been documented and stored for reference by the implementation team. The phased implementation approach ensures manageable development milestones with clear success criteria at each stage.
